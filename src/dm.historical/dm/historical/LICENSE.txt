IMPORTANT NOTE: I consider to forbid institutions of the
European Union (Commission, Council of Ministers, Parliament, ...)
to use software developped by me.
This is in protest against plans of the Council of Ministers to make
logic (general ideas outside of a concrete technical system)
and especially software patentable in Europe.
Note that with such a restriction, this software will cease to be
compatible with the GPL (GNU Public License).
This version does not yet have the restriction but a future version
may.
